Project Proposal: Music Player Management System

1. Introduction
The Music Player Management System is a software application designed to efficiently manage a collection of songs using a Binary Search Tree (BST). This system allows users to add, search, delete, and display songs, providing an organized way to maintain a music library.

2. Objectives

-To develop an efficient music management system using a Binary Search Tree.
-To allow users to add and store song details, including title and artist.
-To enable users to search for specific songs in the library.
-To provide functionality to delete songs from the collection.
-To implement a method to load songs from an external file for ease of use.

3. Scope of the Project

-The system will use a BST data structure to store and manage song records.
-Songs will be stored with attributes: title and artist.
-Users will be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on songs.
-The system will include a simple command-line interface for interaction.
-Songs can be loaded from an external file and stored in memory during execution.

4. System Features

-Add Song: Users can add new songs to the library.
-Search Song: Users can search for a song by title.
-Display Songs: The system displays all songs in an in-order traversal.
-Delete Song: Users can remove a song from the library.
-Load Songs from File: The system reads a list of songs from a file and loads them into the BST.

5. Technology Stack

Programming Language: C
Data Structure: Binary Search Tree (BST)
File Handling: Reading from and writing to text files
User Interface: Command-line interface (CLI)

6. Expected Outcomes

A fully functional music library management system with the ability to add, search, delete, and display songs.
Improved efficiency in handling song records due to the BST implementation.
User-friendly command-line interface for seamless interaction.

7. Future Enhancements

Implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
Additional song attributes such as album, genre, and duration.
Integration with a database for persistent storage.
Playlist management functionality.

8. Conclusion
The Music Player Management System aims to provide a simple yet efficient solution for managing a personal music library. Using a Binary Search Tree ensures optimized search and retrieval operations, making it an effective tool for organizing music collections.
